I have called this place "the captain's shack" because of my alleged ressemblance to the advertising mascot for the Birds Eye frozen food brand. While known in the english speaking world as "[Captain Birdseye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Birdseye)", french speakers know him as "[Captain Iglo](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Iglo)".

This commercial shows well what the character is. I feel very much like this.

I let you judge by yourself.
